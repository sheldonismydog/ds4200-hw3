        <h2>Kirby's Epic Yarn Side Characters</h2>
        <p>These fab buddies run little challenges, decorate rooms, or just make Patch Land feel more inhabited. For the challenges, you basically run through the past levels you have already mastered but with tasks of finding characters, speedrunning, collecting gems, or carrying items! A super fun sidequest to collect all of the in-game items to decorate your apartment.</p>
